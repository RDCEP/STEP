# STEP (Storm Tracking and Evaluation Protocol)

STEP is a Python package that identifies, tracks, and computes physical characteristics of rainstorms given spatiotemporal precipitation data. The algorithms herein are implementations of those proposed by Chang et al. in [*Changes in Spatiotemporal Precipitation Patterns in Changing Climate Conditions*](https://geosci.uchicago.edu/~moyer/MoyerWebsite/Publications/Papers/Changes_Spatio-temporal_Precipitation_patterns.pdf), released by the [Center for Robust Decision-making on Climate and Energy Policy](https://www.rdcep.org). For implementation details, see the [wiki](https://github.com/bkleeman/STEP-suggestions/wiki).

*Note: Due to the time and space complexity of the computations used to track storms, it is highly recommended that runs of any substance be done on machines designed specifically for tasks of such computational weight.*

## Installation

To manually install STEP:
1. Download the repository.
2. Open a terminal window and cd to the root directory where `setup.py` can be found.
3. Execute ```$ python setup.py install```.


<> (To install STEP, use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).)

<>(```bash
pip install STEP
```)

## Dependencies
|Name|Version|
|--|--|
|[imageio](https://imageio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html)|2.8.0|
|[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/3.2.2/users/installing.html)|3.2.1|
|[netCDF4](https://unidata.github.io/netcdf4-python/netCDF4/index.html)|1.5.3|
|[NumPy](https://numpy.org/install/)|1.18.5|
|[scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/install.html)|0.17.2|
|[SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/install.html)|1.4.1|

 *[Basemap](https://matplotlib.org/basemap/users/installing.html) is necessary when using the example plotting function `storms_with_map` found in the [Tutorial](https://github.com/relttira/STEP/wiki/Tutorial). Additionally, the results of the package can be plotted using your visualization library of choice.*
## Usage

Please see the [Tutorial](https://github.com/relttira/STEP/wiki/Tutorial) for a comprehensive introduction to package use. See [Implementation Details](https://github.com/relttira/wiki/Implementation-Details) for function signatures and usage tips. You can also call [`help`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#help)`(function)` for information on these and functions called therein. Depending on the function, calling `help` may provide more info.

## Notes on Methodology

For more detailed information, see the [Methodology](https://github.com/relttira/STEP/wiki/Methodology) or the [original publication](https://geosci.uchicago.edu/~moyer/MoyerWebsite/Publications/Papers/Changes_Spatio-temporal_Precipitation_patterns.pdf) and its supplemental materials. Please also see the original publication for more information on the reasoning behind the algorithms and the mathematics used.
